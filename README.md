## Public Transport Optimization 

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a mobile application that enhances the public transportation experience by addressing common issues faced by passengers in urban areas. This app will integrate route searches, live tracking, suggestions, and a secure QR-code ticketing system to offer a convenient, reliable alternative to current transportation options. This solution aims to solve problems related to the lack of real-time information, overcrowding, and inefficient ticketing, making public transport a more attractive choice. 
The proposed solution involves a GPS-integrated public transport app with features like route planning, real-time tracking, and cashless secure ticketing. The solution is feasible and scalable to meet business objectives since it supports widely-used mobile and GPS technology, requiring minimal additional infrastructure investment while increasing passenger satisfaction and potentially boosting public transport usage.
